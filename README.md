# freight-transport-data
A simple project based on [freight transport data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giobbu/belgium-obu) which produces spatio-temporal analysis with graphs and maps on the characteristics of the dataset. <br>

# How to install
To facilitate project installation and sharing, the technology stack is based on docker. <br>
Place in the main folder of the project and execute:
```
# only for testing or first boot
docker-compose up -d   
# to see the logs
docker container logs <name>    
# to end containers
docker-compose down
# to test changes to images
docker-compose up -d --build --remove-orphans
```

# Technology stack
The project catalogs two types of documents: road coordinate files in json and event files in csv that record traffic detected under particular conditions. <br>
The read data is written to bson documents in the Mongo database by the ```mongo-init``` container whose sole purpose is to check if the data is present, and if so, insert it as defined in its javascript files. With the ```mongo-express``` container, a user interface is offered that makes it easier to read data in Mongo.
<br>
The data are then read from the Neo4j database, container ```neo4j```, which with ad hoc functions, creates a node for each coordinate for the considered roads and adding attributes related to the query placed on the Mongo database. For example, attributes can be derived for a specific time slot and for specific roads.
<br>
I dati cos√¨ ricavati sono rappresentati su grafici e mappe da notebook Jupyter col container ```notebook```.

# Samples
When the start command is run, the Mongo database is automatically populated with the dataset data.
<br>
To populate the Neo4j database and view some analyses, connect to the Jupyter ```notebook``` container and run the code blocks in the notebook. After running the python file, a first analysis can be a map view of the first 100 streets in Anderlecht, such as: ![Image](./samples/anderlecht-all_streets-6_coords.png)
